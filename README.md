# Raytracing in One Weekend

My Repo of [Ray Tracing in One Weekend](https://raytracing.github.io/books/RayTracingInOneWeekend.html) by Peter Shirley, in various languages that I will implement.

This is an updated repo for the book [Ray Tracing in One Weekend](https://raytracing.github.io/books/RayTracingInOneWeekend.html) by Peter Shirley, which I initially followed at [University](https://github.com/Birmingham-City-Uni/cmp5359-cg-milestones-20-21-F-Dudley).

## Current Languages
- [C++]('C++/README.md')

## Future Languages
- Rust
- C#
- Java

## Requirements
Each language will try to implement:

- An Application framework, providing GUI, windowing, and input handling.
- A Vector Library, from scratch or using an existing library.
- A Ray Tracer, using the Vector Library, that is CPU based including the following:
    - Diffuse Materials
    - Metal Materials
    - Dielectric Materials
    - Camera
    - Lights
    - Multi-threading
    - Anti-aliasing
    - Depth of Field
    - Bounding Volume Hierarchy
    - Texture Mapping
    - Multi-threading
    - Perlin Noise
